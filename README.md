#### I am a software engineer and a philosopher. These days, I work for [Drizly](https://drizly.com/home) as an Implementation Engineer. In a past life, I earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) and was then a professor of philosophy at [The American University in Cairo](https://www.aucegypt.edu/), the [University of Richmond](https://www.richmond.edu/), and the [University of Mary Washington](https://www.umw.edu/). 

#### I write mostly in Ruby on Rails and spend a decent bit of time digging through SQL databases. I like dabbling with React when I want to make things look nice.
